### Cardgame

This is a repo to test the return rate of different card game strategies; currently it only supports blackjack.

One question I've always had about different strategies was the effect other people's strategies had on yours.  My hypothesis was that it would be minimal, but I figured it'd be fun to test regardless.

I'm returning (05/20/2023) to play around with this project and add additional features.
